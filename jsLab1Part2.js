// The distance of the trip, in total, is 1,500 miles.
// Your carâ€™s fuel efficiency is as follows:
// At 55 miles per hour, you get 30 miles per gallon.
// At 60 miles per hour, you get 28 miles per gallon.
// At 75 miles per hour, you get 23 miles per gallon.
// You have a fuel budget of $175.
// The average cost of fuel is $3 per gallon.
// 55=30 60=28 75=23 , b-$175 , avg f $3
//How many gallons of fuel will you need for the entire trip?
// Will your budget be enough to cover the fuel expense?
// How long will the trip take, in hours?

// Compare the results when traveling at an average of 55, 60, and 75 miles per hour.
//  Which makes the most sense for the trip?

//The initial numbers that must be verified.
